# Clone-80
TRS-80 Model I clone
A clone of the TRS-80 Model I.

The intention is to if possible clone the Model III as well.

This is not a "vintage parts" clone; modern parts will be used as
appropriate.  fr instance, instead of 24 4116 DRAN cgios, one or two 32MB
static RAMS will be used instead.

At least three areas will need some redesigning.
The TRS-80 and "standard PC" leyboards have different mu,eric key layouts.
